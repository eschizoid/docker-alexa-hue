# docker-alexa-hue
Docker build for Alexa / Philips Hue enhanced integration. This build provides the initial installation / configuration for the local application server component.

**NOTE:** Unfortunately the automated build feature on the official Docker Hub only runs the normal x86_64 docker implementation. Since arm code is not something an x86_64 CPU can execute, there is no way to automate this build.
